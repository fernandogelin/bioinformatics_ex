# Rosalind problems:
# Frequent Words Problem:
# This is the first problem in a collection of "code challenges" to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on Stepic.

# A k-mer is defined as a string of length k. We define Count(Text, Pattern) as the number of times that a k-mer Pattern appears as a substring of Text. For example,

# Count(ACAACTATGCATACTATCGGGAACTATCCT,ACTAT)=3

# We note that Count(CGATATATCCATAG, ATA) is equal to 3 (not 2) since we should account for overlapping occurrences of Pattern in Text.

# We say that Pattern is a most frequent k-mer in Text if it maximizes Count(Text, Pattern) among all k-mers. For example, "ACTAT" is a most frequent 5-mer in "ACAACTATGCATCACTATCGGGAACTATCCT", and "ATA" is a most frequent 3-mer of "CGATATATCCATAG".

# Find the most frequent k-mers in a string.

# Given: A string Text and an integer k.

# Return: All most frequent k-mers in Text.
